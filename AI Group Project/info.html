        <h2>Introduction to Generative AI </h2>
        <h3>What is Generative AI</h3>
        <p>Generative AI is a subsection of Artificial Intelligence that can create new content based on existing data. (JP Morgan) Generative AI looks to create new content for users that can help them across many fields such as content creation, data analysis, and marketing. The use of AI can help in many different applications that are significantly cheaper than any other options. It is far more efficient than any human can ever be and is rapidly growing into the future. As it is able to solve more complex problems each day it is used and being further developed. The main difference between generative Ai and Traditional AI is the application they provide, Traditional AI looks to analyze data and make predictions. Where Generative AI is more capable and is able to create new data sets using the input and existing language. Gathering past data to create new ideas from the data generating new content and using existing knowledge to develop new content.</p>
        <h3>Advantages of using Generative AI</h3>
        <p>There are many different advantages of using Generative AI such as cost and efficiency. This is seen throughout all offers it has such as creating code, image generation, writing, and data analytics. It is able to offer very quick solutions to problems with ease and can be used by anyone helping limit many expenses in a company or group. Generative AI is also extremely helpful when looking to elaborate on other work such as writing and coding. AI is able to quickly develop a solution to a problem or edit that a person wrote, helping further their work and allowing less errors in human work. It becomes an extremely useful tool when helping humans create more perfect work.</p>
        <h3>Disadvantages of Generative AI</h3>
        <p>Although there are many useful applications in Generative AI models, it's not perfect. There are many instances of “Hallucination” in Generative AI where the model will straight away from the data it has and make something up that is inaccurate using what it has from its data. This can create a massive problem in using the system that would require the use of a human to check the content and make sure it is on track. Another massive issue with generative AI is they run the risk of copyright infringement as they often repeat the data they have stored to create the generative content the software produces. As the only intelligence they have comes from previous data that is stored in the system. </p>




        <h2> How Generative AI Works </h2>

        <h2> Applications of Generative AI</h2>
        <p>

            Generative AI can be used in almost every professional industry. It can also be applied for personal uses. Since Generative AI means AI that creates new content, it could even be used to code this website. It can be used to generate images, videos, and music. As AI continues to advance, it is important to highlight applications in which AI could be useful.
        </p>

        <h3>Healthcare</h3>
        <p>AI can do many things for healthcare, including making new discoveries and breakthroughs in medication and treatment plans. It also can help doctors by being able to analyze patient notes in order to better diagnose and analyze medical details. The medical field can also use generative AI to progress x-rays, MRIs, and other imaging to see how diseases could progress over time.</p>

        <h3>Software Development</h3>
        <p>Generative AI can generate code in order to cut down on time spent handwriting code, work as a translator, and also automate processes in software development that previously had to be worked on by an individual.</p>

        <h3>Advertising</h3>
        <p>Generative AI has the ability to create new images and slogans for marketing campaigns as well as to help ads reach the target customer group. AI can also help with the back end and less creative side of marketing by being able to create product descriptions and enhance content to improve SEO rankings.</p>

        <h3>Finance</h3>
        <p>AI can analyze the market and create investment recommendations, as well as make communication between a financial professional and the layperson easier by breaking down terms and making them easier to understand. AI can also draft documents using certain specifications that could be helpful to save a financial professional time.</p>

        <h3>Media</h3>
        <p>Since generative AI’s purpose is to create new content, media, and entertainment is the perfect space for this to be used. It can create “visual effects, graphics and streamline editing” as well as generate highlights of events and sports games, much like how people use it to find key points in readings. AI also has the ability to suggest tags to best reach your target audience.</p>



        <h2> Generative AI in Business and Marketing</h2>
        <p>

            Generative AI can be used to automate repetitive tasks, create personalized customer experiences, and boost creativity in marketing campaigns. The top three benefits of generative AI, according to Terry Tolentino, are improved efficiency through automation, hyper-personalized customer experiences, and enhanced creativity and innovation. To delve deeper into these benefits, he describes specific ways generative AI drives efficiency in marketing teams, including automated content creation, reduced oversight, streamlined workflows, and cost reduction. Benefits for hyper-personalized customer experiences include targeted ad campaigns, custom recommendations, personalized subject lines, and real-time offers. Lastly, enhanced creativity and innovation can provide brainstorming support, data-driven insights, fresh perspectives, and rapid prototyping.
            In the article "Generative AI in Marketing: Benefits and 7 Use Cases in 2024," Tolentino also discusses the seven use cases of generative AI in marketing. These use cases include AI-generated text, images, videos, and music, as well as conversational AI for customer service, sentiment analysis, and SEO content optimization. Some examples he provides of AI-generated content include social media posts and captions, illustrations and conceptual visuals, animated explainers and tutorials, and custom sound effects for branded content. Examples given for conversational AI in customer service, sentiment analysis, and SEO content optimization include conducting on-page keyword research, optimizing customer journeys based on emotional cues, and providing 24/7 automated assistance.
            According to IBM’s webpage, “Generative AI in Marketing,” there are three steps to implementing generative AI in marketing. These steps include defining customer experience goals, collecting and analyzing data, choosing generative AI tools, integrating and deploying generative AI, and, lastly, monitoring and improving it. The site also outlines best practices for implementing generative AI in marketing. According to IBM, “While the use of generative AI offers numerous advantages for marketing departments, it also presents some challenges that organizations typically navigate to effectively implement and benefit from the technology.” Data quality and availability, data privacy and user trust, and quality control and consistency across AI models and outputs are a few challenges, along with potential solutions.
            McKinsey and Company wrote a report on how AI-powered marketing and sales reached new heights within generative AI in 2023. They stated, “Our research found that 90 percent of commercial leaders expect to utilize gen AI solutions ‘often’ over the next two years.” They also found the following: there is a clearly defined AI vision and strategy, over 20 percent of digital budgets are invested in AI-related technologies, teams of data scientists are employed to run algorithms that inform rapid pricing strategies and optimize marketing sales, and strategists are looking to the future while outlining straightforward gen AI use cases.

        <h2> Challenges and Limitations of Generative</h2>
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p>
            Despite the many benefits of Generative AI, there are still some inherent flaws and limitations of this tool that must be acknowledged.
            As of its current state, AI is not capable of generating original ideas. Artificial intelligences generate ideas based on already existing data. Creating original thoughts would require the AI to think outside the bounds of its training data and blend ideas together in a creative new way. This is difficult due to the fact that AI often lacks common sense and reasoning. This is because Generative AI currently cannot have a deep understanding of the world and underlying concepts in the same manner as humans.
            The ability to take knowledge and experience in one field and transfer it to perform in a new field is a task AI is still incapable of completing. Artificial intelligences are currently limited only to the field they were specifically designed for.
            Generative AI has also yet to be able to adapt to ever changing environments. While humans can easily make adjustments in their thinking and adapt to changes in real time, an artificial intelligence would need to be retrained with new, updated data.
            For businesses, the implementation of AI can be costly depending on what the AI is to be used for. The more complex the problem is that needs to be solved, the more expensive it could be to develop an artificial intelligence to solve it. According to an AI pricing guide on Clutch, a guide for businesses looking to make purchases, the price for AI development projects typically cost from around $10,000 to $49,000. Prices can even reach up to $200,000 at the most costly. Training an AI also requires a significant amount of energy, resources, and computation power, which limits the accessibility of AI to smaller companies.
            Decisions made by AI are based on the training data it is given, as well as its algorithm. If the data and algorithm contain human biases, the AI can unintentionally perpetuate these biases on a larger scale. For example, if the training data for a facial recognition algorithm fails to include a diverse range of people, the system may not work correctly when trying to recognise the faces of under-represented groups. Decisions made by Generative AI can be difficult to interpret. It is important to be able to understand why the AI came to the conclusion it did so that flawed logic is not followed.

        <h2> Impact of Generative AI on the Job Market</h2>

        <p>The advancements of AI have allowed great strides in science and other fields however, there is also the issue of how it will affect the job market. Due to the ability of generative AI to predict, analyze, and generate content and data it can greatly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of many jobs. With the use of AI however, there also comes the danger of job displacement. One of the most recent advances in AI is the ability to automate non-routine cognitive tasks, processes that involve deeper thinking about repetitive tasks. While this is an enormous advancement in technology it also has the ability to disrupt the job market in a variety of fields.</p>

        <h3>Estimations</h3>
        <p>With the rise of generative AI the amount of jobs that could be replaced range from financial analysis to software development to the creation of art and media. According to some projections the use of generative AI could replace up to 2.5 million jobs in the U.S. alone. There is however, an even greater tendency towards job augmentation with upwards of 11 million jobs being transformed or adjusted by the use of AI. Like any new technology, AI does disrupt the job market, not necessarily by getting rid of jobs but by changing how they work. For more information visit “University of St. Thomas”.</p>

        <h3>What Jobs are Affected</h3>
        <p>While most jobs that are affected by AI will only be changed rather than disappearing completely, many jobs are still at risk of going away. The jobs most likely to be replaced by generative AI are occupations which involve repetitive input tasks such as office support, customer service, and food service. Other jobs are likely to see changes in required skills. Most occupations such as software developers and media jobs are more likely to see a change in skills as the processes become more automated.</p>

        <h3>Effects on Different Demographics</h3>
        <p>The use of generative AI could also disproportionately affect women, as roughly 10 million more women work in jobs which are heavily reliant on AI. Some estimates conclude that nearly 80% of women work in jobs that are at risk due to generative AI. Minority groups are also likely to be affected more for the same reasons, that being the disbursement of different job types across demographics.</p>
